# Audio Restoration Techniques using Extended Kalman Filters: A Detailed Review and Evaluation
This is an individual research project carried out for the university course "Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing".

The report discusses the exploration of audio restoration techniques employing Extended Kalman Filters (EKF). It begins by detailing the formulation of audio signal processing as an EKF problem, followed by an exposition of the general theory of EKF. Specific challenges such as click detection and signal smoothing & reconstruction are delineated within this framework. Additionally, it delves into advanced topics including Noise Estimation and Filtering Enhancements, covering techniques such as Quantile Based Estimation of Background Noise Variance and Improvements in EKFs via the Bootstrap Procedure, Stability Check, and Forward/Backward Filtering. Evaluation methodologies like Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) are proposed for assessing the quality of reconstructed signals. Concluding, a Python Demo Code template is provided, offering a practical avenue for implementing these techniques with modifiability.

The notebook "Code Template.ipynb" presents a sample code that can be modified to be used in real-case scenarios for Audio Restoration tasks.
